In this assignment we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the MNIST data. PCA enables us to represent high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional way by identifying important directions in the data. PCA does this by computing the covariance matrix of the data and then looking at the the eigenvectors of it that correspond to the largest eigenvectors.
